Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions. 
An experience I had where I saw the power of functions was in the first tkinter module 
where we learned to draw using functions! I've played video games when I was younger and 
always wanted to see what it was like to program a video game! And now that I've gotten 
a taste of what its like to program something that creates something visually I feel 
like is one way that computer programmers program in AAA games. 
2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?
The value of a test funciton is to double check the work. It is 
good to set up a second executable method to double check the work 
because sometimes the first intial thought of concept is flawed. 

3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?
The first item of business in my trobleshooting process is to first 
get a grasp on what happening behind the scenes. Then I might be able
to find and detect the problem and fix it. But if not, then I will 
use the debugger and start implementing testing functions at each 
major level of code. One thin I could do to improve my process of 
troubleshooting is to remain calm. I struggle to not get anxiety-
prone when there are time-restrictions on the assignment(s). But I know
that when I put God first I am able to more easily able to remain 
calm and focused.
